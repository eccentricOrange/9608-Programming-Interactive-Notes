To some extent, by having standards and conventions, we alleviate this problem. However, I still find it weirdly difficult to read a piece of code than to write one—the same is true of mathematical proofs and the like.\n",

Many of them are just nuances rather than additional topics, which can be invaluable when tracking down a bug (mistake/fault).

    "Code written in Python is usually **interpreted**. This means that the computer looks at a line of code, converts it to machine code, and immedeatly runs it. It looks at the next line after that. In essence, that allows Python to be run in a [Read–eval–print loop (REPL)](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-repl) environment. What does that mean? You can give the computer one instruction at a time (read), let it run (evaluate), see its output (print), and then give the next one (loop)—an \"interactive\" environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code written in C++ is usually **compiled**. In this case, the computer would convert the entirety of the program into machine code at once, and give it to you. Such a compiled program is called an **executable** (denoted by `.exe` on Windows). There usually no REPL environments for such languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"cells\" in this Notebook behave like mini, slightly weird, REPL environments. So when we asked it to execute the statement `2 == 3`, the computer ran it and came up with a statement `False`. We describe this using the following terminology: `2 == 3` **returned** `False`. When a piece of code does something, and hands you a value, that action is called returning. We didn't tell the computer what to do with this returned `False` value (such as remembering it for the future), so it went with its default behaviour and just handed it back to us on the screen. With C++, there was no REPL and hence nothing the program would hand the value back to, so it was just blasted into outer space instead of being returned /s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, truth be told, there's more to returning than passing values around, and the above description very incomplete, but it's a good rule of thumb for getting code to actually do something, and I promise to resolve this lie before long.\n",

    "I actually have several reasons:\n",
    "* **C++ is lower level than Python.** There is no magic in C++ (or its predecessor C). If you want something done, you'll have to do it yourself. I'm borrowing [this idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCOj6vTqMxU) from [Harvard University's CS50x course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), which is taught primarily in C. I think you might have a better handle on programming in general (which *will* help with exams) if you see the gory details of C++. Having said that, you don't *need* to remember it at all—just make sure you get the concept, then you can stick to Python.\n",
    "* **Programming is supposed to be a transferable skill.** The syllabus expects you to understand and appreciate different \"paradigms\" (in paper 4). I think this idea will be refined if you are exposed to different languages—it would allow you to focus on the bigger picture and appreciate the general takeaways. Besides, [recent research suggests that we learn the best when exposed to various perspectives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhgwIhB58PA).\n",
    "* **Pseudocode appears to follow syntax closer to C++.** On one hand, yes, CAIE Pseudocode is more like Python in that it it does away with the verbose brackets and semicolons. But many of its concepts (for instance: types of loops, file handling, variable declaration etc) seem to resemble C++ more closely, as you'll discover later.\n",

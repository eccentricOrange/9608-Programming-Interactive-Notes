# Interactive Notes for Computer Science components 9608/2 and 9608/4
This repository contains two [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks which guide the learner through understand the course using Python 3. They allow you to read documentation (explanation) and then try out code immediately. The notebooks are also available using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) and [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), which can run in a web browser, so the viewer does not have to install any software to view them. Binder is one of the recommended platforms for Jupyter notebooks.

These notebooks were originally designed specifically for the [CAIE 9608 Computer Science](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-international-as-and-a-level-computer-science-9608/) syllabus. However, they have been updated to cover the following CAIE syllabuses:
* IGCSE 0478
* IGCSE 0984
* AS & A Level 9608
* AS & A Level 9618

They do not cover the full syllabus but have a comprehensive coverage of the topics directly related to programming.

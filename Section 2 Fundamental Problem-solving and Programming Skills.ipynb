    "# Introduction\n",
    "This is a course/reference for CAIE Computer Science Problem-solving and Programming, meant to help you understand the content alongside the textbooks. I try to cover most of the syllabus directly related to Python programming, trying to provide an alternate explanation where possible. I also talk about some parts (like expressions, and the `range()` function) which are sometimes not well explained by textbooks.\n",

Apart from the Boolean `if` and `else` statements, Python supports `elif` statements (this is equivalent to `else if () { }` in some languages like C++). Using this approach, each `elif` and a single `if` statement form the cases the programmer must explicitly program; the `else` statement forms the `OTHERWISE` case the program needn't care to program."

    "The number of **iterations** that have to occur has to be specified in advance. A common example is a `FOR` loop. Usually, a variable called a **counter** is declared with some initial value (often 0), and with each **pass** of the loop, some mathematical operation is performed on it (often adding 1, aka **incrementing**); if a constant value is added/subtracted, the value is called the **step**. The value of the counter can be accessed like any other identifier. This readily available number, that goes through a pre-determined number of values, makes `FOR` loops a natural choice in many applications involving **arrays**. A `FOR` loop terminates when some condition, related to the counter, is met. For example, a loop to print out the marks students of a class with 25 students scored, would start with the counter set to 0, increment it after each pass (after printing a mark) and then terminate when the counter is equal to 24."

    "## 2.3.6: Structured programming\n",
    "Properly structured programs have benefits other than readability: they often execute more efficiently and **subroutines** are the backbone of **decomposition**. A subroutine can be thought of as a shortcut to a block of statements. If a block of statements defined inside a subroutine have to be executed, they don't have to written in their entirety; instead, they can be **called** using a single line of code. Subroutines allow code to be reused very efficiently (and allow lazy programmers  to exist) as a subroutine can be called in several places without having to rewrite in each instance. There are two basic concepts that determine how a subroutine is designed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Arguments**: It is possible to make a routine run on the basis of a value **passed** into it. For example, for a **function** that squares a number $x$ and returns $x^2$, $x$ is the argument that is passed into it. The function *cannot run* if this is not provided. In contrast, a subroutine that returns a random number, always between 0 and 1, needn't have any arguments.\n",
    "* **Return value(s)**: A **function** can **return** a value after execution. Continuing the example of $x^2$ from above, the function can return the value to the parent construct. This means that if it is placed inside another subroutine (such as the `print()` statement), the parent routine can access the value (the `print()` statement can print it); or if the function is assigned to an *identifier*, the value will be stored in that identifier. In contrast, a **procedure** does not return anything—it cannot be assigned to an identifier or placed inside a construct that expects a value. For example, the squaring subroutine might simply print the value out to the user—in this case it needn't return anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of subroutines: a `PROCEDURE` and a `FUNCTION`. In both cases, the programmer must decide whether or not any arguments are required. The only difference between them is of returning values: a function *must return a value* and a procedure *cannot return a value*. While the distinction between a procedure and a function can be crucial when planning a project, they are defined almost identically in Python 3. If a subroutine has the `return` keyword to return a value, it is a function; else it is a procedure. Specifying arguments/**parameters** is similar too—if a parameter is specified in the **declaration**, the subroutine will accept arguments; else it will not.\n",

    "Arrays are data structures that allow multiple values of a given datatype to be stored without using multiple identifiers. Each value is stored in a memory location, and this can be accessed using a number, the **index** (written in square brackets `[]`). Arrays are usually **zero-indexed**: the index value of the first element is 0 (and not 1). Consider, for example, an array called `Fruits` which holds the names of fruits to be bought on a particular shopping trip; to access the element at index `i` we use the syntax `Fruits[i]`. The first element is `Fruits[0]`; the sixth element is `Fruits[5]`; and, in general, the n<sup>th</sup> element is `Fruits[n - 1]`. The **lower bound** of an array is the index of the first element (usually 0), and the **upper bound** is the index of the last element (usually one less than the total number of elements).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, it is usual to use a different type of structure called a **list**. A list is **dynamic** (its length can be changed after it has been initialized) and **mutable** (elements can have different datatypes). However, arrays are **static** (not dynamic) and **immutable**, and we will treat Python lists as arrays.\n",

    "A computer **file** is a computer resource for recording data discretely in a computer storage device. Just as words can be written to paper, so can information be written to a computer file. Files can be edited and transferred through the internet on that particular computer system. By using computer programs, a person can open, read, change, save, and close a computer file. Computer files may be reopened, modified, and copied an arbitrary number of times. Typically, files are organised in a file system, which keeps track of where the files are located on disk and enables user access."

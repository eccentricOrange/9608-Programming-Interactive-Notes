    "## 2.3.4: Iteration\n",
    "**Loops** allow blocks of code to be repeated, and are another crucial construct. There are two basic categories of loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <u>Count controlled loops</u>: the number of **iterations** that have to occur has to be specified in advance. A common example is a `FOR` loop. Usually, a variable called a **counter** is declared with some initial value (often 0), and with each **pass** of the loop, some mathematical operation is performed on it (often adding 1, aka **incrementing**); if a constant value is added/subtracted, the value is called the **step**. The value of the counter can be accessed like any other identifier. This readily available number, that goes through a pre-determined number of values, makes `FOR` loops a natural choice in many applications involving **arrays**. A `FOR` loop terminates when some condition, related to the counter, is met. For example, a loop to print out the marks students of a class with 25 students scored, would start with the counter set to 0, increment it after each pass (after printing a mark) and then terminate when the counter is equal to 24.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <u> Condition based loops</u>: the number of times a loop executes need not be known in advance. Instead, the loop would terminate when some **condition** is met. The condition must be an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value. A **pre-condition loop** (a `WHILE` loop) runs while the expression evaluates to `TRUE` and terminates as soon as it evaluates to `FALSE`. A **post-condition loop** (a `REPEAT UNTIL` loop) until the expression evaluates to `TRUE`. As their names suggest, the condition is checked *before* the first iteration in a pre-condition loop, and it is possible that the loop *may not execute at all* if the condition is initially `FALSE`; the condition is checked *after* the first iteration in a post-condition loop, and it *must execute at least once*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 does not support post-condition loops; `WHILE` loops are the only condition loops that can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python 3, the `for` loop does not obey a counter. Instead, `for` loops always step through the elements of a list, and it is possible to avoid manually indexing an array if all of its contents have to accessed in the order they are available: the identifier previously referred to as a counter would just return the array element corresponding to the current pass. Having written so, Python 3 does offer a function `range(n)` that returns a list with `n` consecutive integers starting at zero - a `for` loop can use this to control its iterations. `range()` allows the initial value, final value and step to be controlled, and the it is encouraged to explore this."

    "## 2.3.6: Structured programming\n",
    "Properly structured programs have benefits other than readability: they often execute more efficiently and **subroutines** are the backbone of **decomposition**. A subroutine can be thought of as a shortcut to a block of statements. If a block of statements defined inside a subroutine have to be executed, they don't have to written in their entirety; instead, they can be **called** using a single line of code. Subroutines allow code to be reused very efficiently (and allow lazy programmers  to exist) as a subroutine can be called in several places without having to rewrite in each instance. There are two basic concepts that determine how a subroutine is designed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <u>Arguments</u>: It is possible to make a routine run on the basis of a value **passed** into it. For example, for a **function** that squares a number $x$ and returns $x^2$, $x$ is the argument that is passed into it. The function *cannot run* if this is not provided. In contrast, a subroutine that returns a random number, always between 0 and 1, needn't have any arguments.\n",
    "* <u>Return value(s)</u>: A **function** can **return** a value after execution. Continuing the example of $x^2$ from above, the function can return the value to the parent construct. This means that if it is placed inside another subroutine (such as the `print()` statement), the parent routine can access the value (the `print()` statement can print it); or if the function is assigned to an *identifier*, the value will be stored in that identifier. In contrast, a **procedure** does not return anything - it cannot be assigned to an identifier or placed inside a construct that expects a value. For example, the squaring subroutine might simply print the value out to the user - in this case it needn't return anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of subroutines: a `PROCEDURE` and a `FUNCTION`. In both cases, the programmer must decide whether or not any arguments are required. The only difference between them is of returning values: a function *must return a value* and a procedure *cannot return a value*. While the distinction between a procedure and a function can be crucial when planning a project, they are defined almost identically in Python 3. If a subroutine has the `return` keyword to return a value, it is a function; else it is a procedure. Specifying arguments/**parameters** is similar too - if a parameter is specified in the **declaration**, the subroutine will accept arguments; else it will not.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **library** (called a **module** in Python) often allows you to use a number of pre-defined subroutines. Python ships with many modules built in (such as `array`, `time`, `random`, `pickle` - which you may have already used) but many, many more can be [installed using a command-line tool](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/). Any time the `import` keyword is used, a module is being added to a program."

    "Arrays are data structures that allow multiple values of a given datatype to be stored without using multiple identifiers. Each value is stored in a memory location, and this can be accessed using a number, the **index** (written in square brackets `[]`). Arrays are usually **zero-indexed**: the index value of the first element is 0 (and not 1). Consider, for example, an array called `Fruits` which holds the names of fruits to be bought on a particular shopping trip; the syntax to access the element at index `i` we use the syntax `Fruits[i]`. The first element is `Fruits[0]`; the sixth element is `Fruits[5]`; and, in general, the n<sup>th</sup> element is `Fruits[n - 1]`. The **lower bound** of an array is the index of the first element (usually 0), and the upper bound is the index of the last element (usually one less than the total number of elements).\n",

    "In Python, it is usual to use a different type of structure called a **list**. A list is **dynamic** (its length can be changed after it has been initialized) and **mutable** (elements can have different datatypes). However, arrays are **static** (not dynamic) and **immutable**, and we will treat Python lists as arrays.\n",

    "A computer **file** is a computer resource for recording data discretely in a computer storage device. Just as words can be written to paper, so can information be written to a computer file. Files can be edited and transferred through the internet on that particular computer system. By using computer programs, a person can open, read, change, save, and close a computer file. Computer files may be reopened, modified, and copied an arbitrary number of times. Typically, files are organised in a file system, which keeps track of where the files are located on disk and enables user access."

    "* Flowcharts\n",
    "* Pseudocode\n",

    "### 2: Basic constructs\n",
    "Many algorithms consist of the four basic constructs ofprogramming.\n",
    "* **Assignment:** storing a value, either a <u>literal</u> value or an <u>expression</u> that returns a value, in a variable.\n",
    "* **Sequence:** program statements may execute consecutively, or parallely alongside eachother. The sequence need not be known ahead of time and can be determined programatically.\n",
    "* **Selection:** programs can determine which statements are to be execute based on conditions (using `IF` and `CASE` structures, for example).\n",
    "* **Repetition:** statements in a program can be repeated either a fixed number of times, or based on a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple algorithms follow the **input-process-output cycle** at various places, i.e., they take in an input, perform some processing on it, and then return it back. For example, consider an algorithm which takes in the radius `r` of a circle as its input. It then multiplies the value with `2 _pi` (this is the processing). Finally it outputs the product `2 _pi r` which is the length of the circumfrence of the circle.\n",

    "**Decomposition** is the process of breaking down a complex process into smaller parts. The process can be broken down repeatedly until the sub-tasks can be performed by small and managable **procedures** or **functions**; this process is called **stepwise refinement**. Throughout this process, **pattern recognition** is used to identify those parts which are similar and could use the same solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4: Logic statements\n",
    "Conditions are often specified using Boolean logic statements, which are expressions that return a `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Logic statements are essential because they let a program control execution (using loops, selection statements and conditional loops)."

    "Arrays are data structures that allow multiple values of a given datatype to be stored without using multiple identifiers. Each value is stored in a memory location, and this can be accessed using a number, the **index** (written in square brackets `[]`). Arrays are usually **zero-indexed**: the index value of the first element is 0 (and not 1). Consider, for example, an array called `Fruits` which holds the names of fruits to be bought on a particular shopping trip; the syntax to access the element at index `i` we use the suntax `Fruits[i]`. TThe first element is `Fruits[0]`; the sixth element is `Fruits[5]`; and, in general, the n<sup>th</sup> element is `Fruits[n - 1]`. The **lower bound** of an array is the index of the first element (usually 0), and the upper bound is the index of the last element (usually one less than the total number of elements).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, it is usual to use a a different type of structure called a **list**. A list is **dynamic** (its length can be changed after it has been initialized) and **mutable** (elements can have different datatypes). However, arrays are **static** (not dynamic) and **immutable**, and we will treat Python lists as arrays."

A 1D (with a single dimension) array, such as `Fruits` from above, can be represented as a list of values - not unlike a number line. In fact, this analogy from graphs gives us a way to represent 2D arrays: as two axes make a grid, two dimensions of an array can be visualized as a table. Consider, for example, a 2D array called `Marks` which stores the marks of students in a class where everyone studeies Computer Science, Further Mathematics and Physics. Each \"row\" then represents one student, and each \"column\" represents one subject. The syntax to access an element is `Marks[i][j]` where `i` is the index of the row and `j` is the index of the column.\n",

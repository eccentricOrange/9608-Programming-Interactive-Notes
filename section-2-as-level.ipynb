    "Welcome to this course on Programming and Problem-solving! It exists mainly because my own A Level Computer Science textbook turned out to be rather boring. I'm not sure I can solve that problem for most people since I'm a boring guy, but I'll give it a shot.\n",

    "Presumably, we learn software programming to ~~learn about problem-solving, develop logical reason skills, and develop a professionally useful skill-set~~ get a computer to do whatever the heck we want it to. If a computer science course can't achieve that, I'm out; and so should you be if it doesn't meet *your* goals (that applies to this Notebook too, but in that case, please tell how I can improve it).\n",

    "Having said so, there are genuinely interesting things to do here: mysteries to solve, an opportunity for you to use your creativity, and be expressive about your styles and preferences. I hope that you can walk away from this (and your books and teachers and classes) with some curiosity towards and, hopefully, a little love and appreciation about this new set of tools."

    "This is a running joke among programmers, but it has a grain of truth. When you write something, you have a certain viewpoint on it that makes it all obvious to you. But not to a stranger. To some extent, by having standards and conventions, we alleviate this problem. However, I still find it weirdly difficult to read a piece of code than to write one—the same is true of mathematical proofs and the like.\n",

    "I'm not going to shy away from diving to the details of topics as they come along. Some of these details can be really useful in the process of writing code, especially if you decide to do something of your own outside the exam structure. Many of them are just nuances rather than additional topics, which can be invaluable when tracking down a bug (mistake/fault). But you might never be asked to discuss (about 30% of?) these ideas directly, so feel forget the specifics later down the line.\n",

So take a look at their [FAQ \\(Getting Started\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_getting_started).

It looks at the next line after that. In essence, that allows Python to be run in a [Read–eval–print loop (REPL)](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-repl) environment. What does that mean? You can give the computer one instruction at a time (read), let it run (evaluate), see its output (print), and then give the next one (loop)—an \"interactive\" environment.\n",

    "Code written in C++ is usually **compiled**. In this case, the computer would convert the entirety of the program into machine code at once, and give it to you. Such a compiled program is called an **executable** (denoted by `.exe` on Windows). There usually no REPL environments for such languages.\n",

    "The \"cells\" in this Notebook behave like mini, slightly weird, REPL environments. So when we asked it to execute the statement `2 == 3`, the computer ran it and came up with a statement `False`. We describe this using the following terminology: `2 == 3` **returned** `False`. When a piece of code does something, and hands you a value, that action is called returning. We didn't tell the computer what to do with this returned `False` value (such as remembering it for the future), so it went with its default behaviour and just handed it back to us on the screen.\n",

    "* **C++ is lower level than Python.** There is no magic in C++ (or its predecessor C). If you want something done, you'll have to do it yourself. I'm borrowing this idea from [Harvard University's CS50x course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), which is taught primarily in C. I think you might have a better handle on programming in general (which *will* help with exams) if you see the gory details of C++. Having said that, you don't *need* to remember it at all—just make sure you get the concept, then you can stick to Python.\n",
    "* **Programming is supposed to be a transferable skill.** The syllabus expects you to understand and appreciate different \"paradigms\" (in paper 4). I think this idea will be refined if you are exposed to different languages—it would allow you to focus on the bigger picture and appreciate the general takeaways. Besides, [recent research suggests that we learn the best when exposed to various perspectives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhgwIhB58PA).\n",
    "* **Pseudocode appears to follow syntax closer to C++.** On one hand, yes, CAIE Pseudocode is more like Python in that it it does away with the verbose brackets and semicolons. But many of its concepts (for instance: types of loops, file handling, variable declaration etc) seem to resemble C++ more closely, as you'll discover later.\n",

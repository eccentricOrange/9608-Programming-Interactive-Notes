If a computer science course can't acheive that, I'm out; and so should you be if it doesn't meet *your* goals (including this Notebook, but in that case, please tell how I can improve it).\n",

What does that mean? You can give the computer one instruction at a time (read), let it run (evaluate), see its output (print), and then give the next one (loop)—an \"interactive\" environment.\n",

    "Code written in C++ is usually **compiled**. In this case, the computer would convert the entirety of the program into machine code at once, and give it to you.

So when we asked it to execute the statement `2 == 3`, the computer ran it and came up with a statement `False`. We describe this using the following terminology: `2 == 3` **returned** `False`. When a piece of code does something, and hands you a value, that action is called returning. We didn't tell the computer what to do with this returned `False` value (such as remembering it for the future), so it went with its default behaviour and just handed it back to us on the screen.\n",

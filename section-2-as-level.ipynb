If a computer science course can't acheive that, I'm out; and so should you be (including this Notebook, but in that case, please tell how I can improve it).\n",

To some extent, by having standards and conventions, we alleviate this problem. However, I still find it weirdly difficult to read a piece of code than to write one—the same is true of mathematical proofs and the like.\n",

This is still pretty darn complex. Assembly language is sometimes used in places with very tight constraints (on things like me memory and CPU time).\n",

For now, don't worry about what `int` means, the weird assortment of brackets, or the fact that I've written an equals sign twice (`==`). I *will* tell you that this is doing a **logical operation**, but more on that later.\n",
